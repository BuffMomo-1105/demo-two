        <h3>Introduction</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="policy-desc">
        <p>
          Capital Creek Broking Service LLP is committed to the highest
          standards of compliance against money laundering (AML) and
          anti-terrorist financing (CTF). The objective of the Companies Policy
          against Money Laundering and Terrorism Financing is to actively
          prevent the risks of these matters. To help the government combat the
          financing of terrorism and money laundering activities, the law
          requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record
          information that identifies each person who opens an account. We have
          an obligation to report suspicious client activity relevant to money
          laundering. Money Laundering: The process of converting funds received
          from illegal activities (such as fraud, corruption, terrorism, etc.)
          into other funds or investments that appear legitimate to hide or
          distort the actual source of funds.
        </p>
        <p>
          The money laundering process can be divided into three sequential
          stages:
        </p>
        <div class="desc-heading">
          <h3>I. Placement</h3>
        </div>
        <p>
          At this stage, the funds are turned into financial instruments, such
          as checks, bank accounts, and money transfers, or they can be used to
          buy high-value goods that can be resold. They can also be physically
          deposited in banks and non-bank institutions (eg exchange houses). To
          avoid suspicion on the part of the company, the bleach can also make
          several deposits instead of depositing the entire sum at once, this
          form of placement is called smurf.
        </p>
        <div class="desc-heading">
          <h3>II. Layers</h3>
        </div>
        <p>
          The funds are transferred or moved to other accounts and other
          financial instruments. It is done to disguise the origin and interrupt
          the indication of the entity that carried out the multiple financial
          transactions. Moving funds and changing their form makes it difficult
          to track the money that is being laundered.
        </p>
        <div class="desc-heading">
          <h3>III. Integration</h3>
        </div>
        <p>
          TThe funds are re-circulated as legitimate to purchase goods and
          services.

          company's services by criminals, with the objective of money
          laundering, terrorist financing or other criminal activity.

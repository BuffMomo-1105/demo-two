          1.1 Capital Creek Broking Service LLC LLC operating under the trading
          name B2pip regulated and authorised by the Saint Vincent and the
          Grenadines under the Licence Number: 2795 LLC 2022 (hereinafter called

          1.2 This notice is provided to you because you are considering dealing
          with the Company in the investment products provided by the Company
          (hereinafter called “Securities”). Each investment product and service
          has its own distinct risks. This notice cannot and does not disclose
          or explain all of the risks and other significant aspects involved in
          these products or how such risks relate to your personal

          1.3 Prior to applying for an account, you should consider carefully
          whether trading in the investment products provided by the Company
          (“Securities”) is suitable for you in light of your needs,
          circumstances and financial situation. It is important that you fully
          understand the risks involved before making a decision to enter into a
          CFD transaction / contract with us or to buy or sell an instrument
          available through a share trading account you may hold with the
          Company. If you are in any doubt about the risks involved with your

        <h3>2. Risk warnings</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="policy-desc">
        <p>
          2.1 The Company offers its services on an ‘execution-only basis’. It
          does not provide you with investment advice relating to its services,
          Securities or possible transactions in Securities and does not make
          investment recommendations of any kind. We sometimes provide factual
          information or research recommendations about a market, information
          about transaction procedures and information about the potential risks
          involved and how those risks may be minimised. However, any decision
          to use our investment products or services is solely made by you.
        </p>
        <p>
          2.2 The Company does not and cannot guarantee the initial capital of
          your portfolio or its value at any time or any money invested in any
          Security. You hereby unreservedly acknowledge and accept that,
          regardless of any information which may be offered by the Company, the
          value of the Securities provided by the Company may fluctuate
          downwards or upwards and it is even probable that the investment may
          become of no value.
        </p>
        <p>
          2.3 You acknowledge that you run a great risk of incurring losses and
          damages as a result of the purchase and/or sale of any Security, as
          such transactions undertaken through the dealing services of the
          Company may be of a speculative nature. Large losses may occur in a
          short period of time, equalling the total of your funds deposited with
          the Company. You should not enter into a transaction / contract with
          the Company unless you are willing to undertake the risk of losing
          entirely all the funds which you have invested.
        </p>
        <p>
          2.4 A derivative Security is a ‘non -deliverable’ transaction giving
          an opportunity to make profit on changes in currency rates, changes in
          prices of commodity, equity indices, shares or cryptocurrencies
          (called the “underlying instrument”).
        </p>
        <p>
          2.5 You are solely responsible to monitor all of your open positions
          closely. Particularly, it is your sole on CFDs or hold any Securities
          in a share trading account, you should ensure that you have the
          ability to access your trading account(s) at all times.
        </p>
        <p>
          2.6 Some Securities may not become immediately liquid as a result, for
          example, of reduced demand and you may not be in a position to sell
          them or easily obtain information on the value of these Securities or
          the extent of the associated risks.
        </p>
        <p>
          2.7 If you trade in a market other than the base currency of your
          country of residence, any currency exchange fluctuations will impact
          the value, price and performance of the Security you traded in
          (therefore, it will impact your profits and losses).
        </p>
        <p>
          2.8 Information on past performance of a Security does not guarantee
          its future performance. The use of historical data does not constitute
          a binding or safe forecast as to the corresponding future performance
          of the Securities to which the said information refers. Contracts you
          enter into with us are legally enforceable by both parties.

        <h3>3. Volatility of price and limitation on the available market</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="policy-desc">
        <p>
          3.1 Some of the Securities provided by the Company are derivative
          Securities, where their price is derived from the price of the
          underlying reference Securities in which the Securities refer to.
          Placing ‘Stop Loss’ Orders serves to limit your losses. However,
          derivative markets can be highly volatile and the value of derivative
          Securities and their underlying instrument may fluctuate rapidly under
          certain market conditions. Under such conditions the execution of a
          ‘Stop Loss’ Order may be worse than its stipulated (i.e. Client’s
          preset) price and the realized losses may be larger than expected. It
          may also be difficult or impossible to execute any type of order;
          therefore, ‘Stop Loss’ order cannot guarantee the limit of loss.
        </p>
        <p>
          3.2 Movements in the price of underlying markets can be volatile and
          unpredictable. This will have a direct impact on your profits and
          losses; thus, knowing the volatility of an underlying market will
          assist you in evaluating whether any ‘Stop orders should be placed.
        </p>
        <p>
          3.3 Your attention is expressly drawn, among others, to currencies
          traded infrequently that it cannot be certain that a price will be
          quoted at all times or that it may be difficult to effect transactions
          at a price which may be quoted owing to the absence of a counterparty.
        </p>
        <p>
          3.4 The prices of Securities will be influenced by, amongst other
          factors/events, changing supply and demand relationships,
          governmental, agricultural, commercial and trade programs and
          policies, national and international political and economic events and
          the market sentiment.
        </p>
        <p>
          3.5 ‘Gapping’ is a sudden shift in the price of an underlying market
          from one level to another and can occur when the underlying market is
          either open or even closed due to various factors/events (e.g.,
          release of important news announcements, economic events, etc.). When
          such factors/events occur and the underlying market is closed, the
          price of the underlying market when it re-opens (and consequently our
          derived price) may be different from the closing price with no
          opportunity to sell the instrument(s) before the market opens.
        </p>
        <p>
          3.6 Market conditions can change significantly in a very short period
          of time. As such, in case the Client wishes to sell an instrument or
          close a Contract, he may not be able to do so under the same terms as
          when he purchased or opened it. Under certain trading conditions, it
          may be difficult or impossible to liquidate a position. This may
          occur, for example, at times of rapid price movement if the price
          rises or falls in one trading session to such an extent that under the
          rules of the relevant exchange trading is suspended or restricted.
        </p>
        <p>
          3.7 Transactions in derivative Securities are not undertaken on a
          recognized and regulated exchange (i.e., undertaken through the
          Company’s Trading Platform) and, as such, they may expose the Client
          to greater risks than regulated exchange transactions. The terms and
          conditions and trading rules may be established solely by the
          counterparty, which in this case is the Company. You may only be able
          to close an open position of any given Security during the operating
          hours of the Company’s Trading Platform. You will also have to close
          any position with the same counterparty with whom it was originally
          entered into.

        <h3>4. Margin requirements</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="policy-desc">
        <p>
          4.1 Clients are required to deposit a Margin with the Company in order
          to open a position on a CFD. The Margin requirement will depend on the
          underlying instrument of the derivative Securities, level of leverage
          chosen and the value of position to be established. The Company will
          not notify the Client for any Margin Call to sustain a loss-making
          position. The Company has the discretionary right to start closing
          positions when Margin Level decreases to around 50%, and automatically
          close all positions at market prices if Margin Level drops reaches or
          falls below 20%. The Company guarantees that there will be no negative
          balance in a client’s account when trading in Securities provided by
          the Company.
        </p>
        <p>
          4.2 Investing in derivative Securities entails the use of “gearing” or
          “leverage”. In considering whether to engage in this form of
          investment, you should be aware that the high degree of “gearing” or
          “leverage” is a particular feature of derivative Securities. This
          stems from the margining system applicable to such trades, which
          generally involves a comparatively modest deposit or margin in terms
          of the overall contract value, so that a relatively small movement in
          the underlying market can have a disproportionately dramatic effect on
          the Client’s trade. If the underlying market movement is in your
          favor, you may achieve a good profit, but an equally small adverse
          market movement may quickly result in the loss of your entire deposit.
          You must not purchase derivative Securities unless you are willing to
          undertake the risks of losing all the money which you have invested.
        </p>
        <p>
          4.3 Should the Equity in your trading account be insufficient to hold
          current positions open, you will be required to deposit additional
          funds at short notice or reduce exposure (i.e., Margin Call). Failure
          to do so within the time required may result in the liquidation of
          positions at a loss (i.e., Stop-Out). The Client is always responsible
          for any losses incurred as a result.

        <h3>5. Specific risk warnings - shares</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="policy-desc">
        <p>
          5.1 Physical Shares admitted to trading on a regulated market are not
          considered high-risk financial instruments.
        </p>
        <p>
          5.2 Shares, known as ‘equities’, represent a portion of a company’s
          share capital. The extent of Client’s ownership in a company depends
          on the number of Shares he owns in relation to the total number of
          Shares in issue.
        </p>
        <p>
          5.3 All Shares offered are listed on exchanges which means that the
          prices are not set by our Company. We will only act on any
          instructions received from you to buy or sell on your behalf with our
          obligation being to take sufficient steps to ensure best execution
          results, as set out in our Order Execution Policy.
        </p>
        <p>
          5.4 The Company may execute Client’s order outside of a regulated
          market (i.e., exchange) as long as this is deemed to be in line with
          our Order Execution Policy. As part of our service, we will arrange
          for the custody of the instruments. All investments purchased for the
          Client or transferred to us by the Client into his Share trading
          account will be purchased in the name of and/or held by a nominee
          company selected by us, for the benefit of the Client. As investments
          will be held in the name of a nominee company, the Client may not have
          voting rights which he would have had if he held the investment in his
          own name.
        </p>
        <p>
          5.5 The value of investments purchased through Client’s Share trading
          account may go down as well as up, in line with market conditions, and
          the Client may end up with less than he/she originally invested. Some
          shares, such as unlisted shares, shares in smaller companies and penny
          shares may present a higher risk than others and may prove difficult
          to liquidate at short notice. If the Client is in a position where he
          wishes to sell these types of shares at short notice after buying
          them, he may find that the sell price is far lower than the price at
          which he bought them. Also, Shares in companies incorporated in
          emerging markets may be harder to buy and sell than Shares in
          companies in more developed markets and former companies may also not
          be adequately regulated.
        </p>
        <p>
          5.6 Instructions to deal from the Client to us form a commitment which
          may only be subsequently revoked by the Client with our prior consent
          (such consent will not be unreasonably withheld) at any time before
          the instruction to deal is executed. All instruments offered through
          our Share trading account are listed on an exchange, which means that
          the prices are not set by us. We will act on any instruction that the
          Client provide us to buy or sell an instrument on his behalf in
          accordance with our obligation to provide best execution results as
          set out in our Order Execution Policy, to act reasonably and in
          accordance with the Terms and Conditions of Business/Client Agreement
          which governs our business relationship.
        </p>
        <p>
          5.7 On many exchanges, the performance of a transaction by us (or
          third-party with whom we are dealing on your behalf) is ‘guaranteed’
          by the exchange or clearing house and we may have the benefit of
          certain legal protections from our clearing member. However, it is
          unlikely that in most circumstances this guarantee or legal
          protections will cover you (i.e., the Client) and may not protect you
          if we or, another party were to default on obligations owed to you.

        <h3>6. Other additional obligations</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="policy-desc">
        <p>
          6.1 Before you begin to trade, you should obtain details of all
          commissions and other charges for which you will be liable and which
          may be found on the Company’s website. If any charges are not
          expressed in money terms (but for example as a dealing spread), you
          should obtain a clear written explanation from the Company, including
          appropriate examples, to establish what such charges are likely to
          mean in specific money terms. You acknowledge and understand that
          commissions and other charges may change at any time and that it is
          your sole responsibility to remain up to date by visiting the
          Company’s website.
        </p>
        <p>
          6.2 Before you begin to trade, you should also obtain details
          regarding the financial instrument you wish to trade in, such as the
          margin requirements, position and/or volume limits, swaps, etc. This
          information is available on the Company’s website. You acknowledge and
          understand that the said information may change at any time and that
          it is your sole responsibility to remain up to date by visiting the
          Company’s website.
        </p>
        <p>
          6.3 The value of open positions in the derivative Securities provided
          by the Company is subject to financing fees (or “swaps”). The swaps
          are deducted (i.e., charged) from or added (i.e., credited) in the
          Client’s account regarding derivative Securities which are held
          overnight throughout the life of the contract. For more information
          regarding swap rates and the respective calculations, please visit the
          Company’s website at  <a href=" http://b2pip.com" target="_blank">http://b2pip.com</a> 
        </p>
        <p>
          6.4 You are responsible for any taxes and/or any other duty or legal
          affairs (i.e., regulatory filings and payments) in order to ensure
          that you comply with applicable laws and regulations. The Company does
          not warrant that no tax and/or any other stamp duty will be payable.
          The Company does not provide any regulatory, tax or legal advice and
          as such, you may wish to seek independent advice.
        </p>
        <p>
          6.5 Although electronic communication is often a reliable way to
          communicate with Clients, no electronic communication is entirely
          reliable or always available. The Client should be aware that
          electronic communications may fail, may be delayed, may not be secure
          and/or may not reach the intended destination.
        </p>
        <p>
          6.6 A Bank or Broker through whom the Company deals or the Company
          itself may act in the same market as the Client, as such its own
          account involvement may be contrary to Client’s interests.
        </p>
        <p>
          6.7 Trading online, no matter how convenient or efficient, does not
          necessarily reduce risks associated with currency trading.
        </p>
        <p>
          6.8 The Company is be required to hold Client Money in an account that
          is segregated from the Company’s money in accordance with the Act and
          Applicable Regulations, but this may not afford a complete protection.
        </p>
        <p>
          6.9 A change in laws or regulations made by the government or a
          regulatory body may increase the costs of operating a business, reduce
          the attractiveness of investment and/or change the competitive
          landscape and as such alter the profit potential of an investment.
        </p>
        <p>
          6.10 The insolvency or default of the Company, a Bank, Broker or any
          other relevant counterparty used by the Company to effect transactions
          may lead to your positions being closed out without your consent.
